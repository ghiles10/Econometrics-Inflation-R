# Econometrics-Inflation-R
As part of the econometrics course, I was interested in inflation in OECD countries. I used the R software and the databases of the OECD and INSEE. I realized a project going from data cleaning to linear regression and tests based on the normality of residuals. 
Indeed, I was interested in the Phillips curve, and in being able to explain the determinants of inflation from macroeconomic variables.
